  document header/footer

[w2l] I18n: If several characters in a row are converted using math mode, they
  are now combined (ie. ${\alpha}{\beta}$ rather than ${\alpha}$${\beta}$)

  included in \thesection, but rather in the formatting. This means that the

  (if the marks are contained in a heading)

[w2l] New option external_bibtex_files gives a list of BibTeX files. If nonempty,

[all] New filter configuration concept: Configuration packages containing an OOo
  template, a w2l configuration and registry information to bind these together:
  When a configuration package is installed in OOo, the configuration is added
  to the filter ui, and is preselected for documents based on the OOo template

[all] Repackaging: Distribution files are included in source, build
  file is extended to create the distribution; source distribution is separated

[all] Changed to new extension format (.oxt)

[all] Filter: Added messagebox to display the error in case an
  exception happens during conversion

[all] Moved default configurations to jar; the FilterData property
  can refer to these using the special url *filename.xml
