	<title>The package writer2latex.latex</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>This package contains LaTeX specific code.</p>
<p>It contains a <code>writerlatex.api.Converter</code> implementation for
conversion into LaTeX.</p>
<p>Since version 1.0 you can build Writer2LaTeX without this package if you
don't need LaTeX support (in this case you can exclude writer2latex.bibtex as
well).</p>
