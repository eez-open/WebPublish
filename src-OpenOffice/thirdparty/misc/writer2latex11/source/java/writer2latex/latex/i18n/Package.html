<body>
<p>This package takes care of i18n for LaTeX.</p>
<p>In LaTeX, i18n is a mixture of inputencodings, fontencodings
  and babel languages. In particualar, the package provides a Unicode->LaTeX
  translation that can handle different inputencodings and fontencodings.</p>
<p>The pacakge could (with modification) in theory be used in other programs
  that convert unicode to LaTeX.</p>
