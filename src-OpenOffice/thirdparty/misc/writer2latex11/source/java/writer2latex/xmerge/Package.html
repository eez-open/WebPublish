<body>
<p>Classes originating from OOo's xmerge.</p>
<p>Previously, Writer2LaTeX was based on xmerge, but this is not the case
anymore. The classes in this packages are reminiscent of that.</p>
<p>This package is supposed to go away in a future version and be replaced by
something else (probably ODFDOM)</p>
