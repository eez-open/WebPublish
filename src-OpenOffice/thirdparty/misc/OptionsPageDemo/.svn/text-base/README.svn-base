OptionsPageDemo extension 1.0
===============================

This NetBeans project contains a sample OpenOffice.org extension.
The extension demonstrates how to add a custom options page within the
existing options pages of Writer. Additionally, the extension shows how
to integrate a custom help for an extension.


Source structure
-----------------

* dialogs: contains the xdl dialog file for the option page. Can be edited
           using OpenOffice.org's built-in dialog editor (see macros).

* registry: contains the customized registry files for storing the configuration
            values of this extension.

* src: the Java sourcecode of the extension.

* help: the xhp help files that are integrated into OOo's help system.


Usage:
-------
Open the project via NetBeans (you need the OpenOffice.org plugin version 2.x or higher),
right-click on the project and press "Deploy and run extension in OpenOffice.org".
If you do not trust this extension, better press "Debug extension..." as this
omitts you local user settings.
